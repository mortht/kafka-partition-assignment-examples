# Partition assignment example

See the behavior of the partition assignment in different configuration

## Pre-requisites
* docker-compose
* [Confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/installing_cp/zip-tar.html)

## How to run

### 1. Producer

In one terminal, start the cluster and producer (you will be asked some questions):

     ./launch-producer.sh

> For each tipic, we will feed it with 600000 records, so it can take some time :-) 

Example:

      ./launch-producer.sh

      ... # producer will be started

### 2. Status
In another terminal, check the status

    ./status.sh <consumer-group>

Example:

      ./status.sh beta1

      Date: 2022-08-07T12:19:24.260758 - consumerGroup: beta1

### 3. Consumers

And in another terminal, launch the consumer group

     ./launch-consumer.sh <strategy> <initial consumers> <consumer-group> <static-assignment>

Strategies can be:
* round: https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/RoundRobinAssignor.html
* range: https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/RangeAssignor.html
* sticky: https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/StickyAssignor.html
* coop: https://kafka.apache.org/32/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/CooperativeStickyAssignor.html

`static-assignment` can be true or false (false by default) (timeout is 10 seconds)

Example:

      ./launch-consumer.sh coop 0 beta1 true
      
      What's next? [a] Add new consumer, [k] kill last consumer, [e] exit: a
      consumer-0 launched [71714]
      
      What's next? [a] Add new consumer, [k] kill last consumer, [e] exit: a
      consumer-1 launched [71717]
      
      What's next? [a] Add new consumer, [k] kill last consumer, [e] exit: a
      consumer-2 launched [71726]
      
      What's next? [a] Add new consumer, [k] kill last consumer, [e] exit: k
      Consumer 2 killed (pid 71726) - Date: Sun Aug  7 12:18:52 CEST 2022
      
      What's next? [a] Add new consumer, [k] kill last consumer, [e] exit: e
      Time to clean up!
      Consumer 0 killed (pid 71714) - Date: Sun Aug  7 12:22:47 CEST 2022
      Consumer 1 killed (pid 71717) - Date: Sun Aug  7 12:22:47 CEST 2022

### Clean up

1. Stop all scripts
2. Run

    docker-compose down -v
